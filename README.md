# Parallelization_MPICH2_C
A collection of codes using MPICH2 (High Performance Message Passing Interface) to handle algorithms which requires large resources on distributed system. [[Old Stuff from old days]] 

Firstly, test your environment for MPICH using "hellompi.c"
The executing program should run on all compute nodes (2^n).
We use the root process to print out the output from all processes.

More information about MPICH and MPI can be found under: https://www.mpich.org/
